This is a heat map calender to track how many hours of work I have done each day.
<br>
<br>
<script src="/js/d3.min.js"></script>
    <style>
    .day {
      stroke: #fff;
    }
    .month {
      fill: none;
      stroke: #000;
      stroke-width: 2px;
    }
    </style>
<div class="calender-map"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/calendermap.js"></script>
