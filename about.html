<br>
My name is Haifeng Jin. I am interested in competitive programming. During my undergraduate life, I founded ACM-ICPC Club in Beijing Forestry University, where I had a great time with a bunch of awesome people with the same interest.<br>
<br>
Then I went to Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunication for my Master's degree, where I did some research on Data Mining and Security.

Driven by the deep passion to become a computer scientist, I decided to go to United States to continue my professional development. Now, I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. I work in <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/research.html">DATA</a> Lab with <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/">Dr. Xia Hu</a>.
My research area is Data Mining. You can find me on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OAj0lr0AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.
