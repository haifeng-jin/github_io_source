### Morning Routines:

Get up at the alarm at 7:30 AM if no special case.

Brush teeth with left hand. Do squat at the same time.

### Right Before Working:

List the important tasks to do today.
Remake the schedule of the day.

Imagine the happiness of working hard, following the schedule and finishing the tasks.

### Evening Routines:

Heading home at 9:00 PM if no special case.

Do exercise right after arriving home.

Take a shower and brush teeth.

Meditate.

Review how I did during the day.

Reading before bed.
