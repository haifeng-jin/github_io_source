<br/>

### Tutorial  
<br/>
Use a stack for the sequence. If it is a "(" push its index in.
If it is a ")", check if the top element is a "(".
If so pop it. Otherwise, push the ")" index in.
After we walked through the whole sequence.
The stack is a list of the indices of the illegal characters.
We just go through it to find the longest gap between two neighbours.

	class Solution(object):
	    def longestValidParentheses(self, s):
		"""
		:type s: str
		:rtype: int
		"""
		stk = []
		for i, ch in enumerate(s):
		    if ch == '(':
		        stk.append(i)
		    elif stk and s[stk[-1]] == '(':
		        stk.pop()
		    else:
		        stk.append(i)
		stk.append(len(s))
		stk = [-1] + stk
		ret = 0
		for i in range(len(stk) - 1):
		    ret = max(ret, stk[i + 1] - stk[i] - 1)
		return ret
