### Tutorial  
<br/>
The ith time you see a candidate, you will have a probability of $$1/i$$ to select it. (i start from 1)
So the overall probability of choosing the xth candidate is $$1/m$$, where m is the total number of candidates. (1 <= x <= m)
It is because if we finally decide to choose xth candidate is independent from whether we changed our decision during any encounter with a candidate before the xth.
And at the encounter of the xth candidate, we choose to change which is of probability $$p=1/x$$.
Then we did not change during any encounter with the rest of the candidates.
So we need to multiply p by $$x/(x+1), (x+1)/(x+2), ..., (m-1)/m$$ which would finaly result in $$1/m$$.

	from random import randint
	
	class Solution(object):
	
	    def __init__(self, nums):
	        """
	        
	        :type nums: List[int]
	        :type numsSize: int
	        """
	        self.nums = nums
	        
	
	    def pick(self, target):
	        """
	        :type target: int
	        :rtype: int
	        """
	        ret = -1
	        count = 0
	        for i, x in enumerate(self.nums):
	            if x == target:
	                if randint(0, count) == 0:
	                    ret = i
	                count += 1
	        return ret
	
	
	# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
	# obj = Solution(nums)
	# param_1 = obj.pick(target)
