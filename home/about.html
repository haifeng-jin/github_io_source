<br>
My name is Haifeng Jin. I am interested in competitive programming. During my undergraduate life, I founded ACM-ICPC Club in Beijing Forestry University, where I had a great time with a bunch of awesome people with the same interest.<br>
<br>
Driven by the deep passion to become a computer scientist, I decided to go to United States to continue my professional development. Now, I am a PhD student in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University.
<br>
<br>
My research area is Internet of Things and Edge Computing. You can find me on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OAj0lr0AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>. Still a long way to go.
