    "Keep unit tests simple and understandable at a glance. Otherwise, the testing code itself is prune to bugs. When writing code, we always want to reduce code duplication. However, writing tests is an exception, because reducing code duplication to the extreme may harm the tests' readability. In summary, we need to balance between better readability and less duplication.",
